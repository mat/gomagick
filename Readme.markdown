Image resizing server written in Go based on ImageMagick, proof of concept.

See in action at <http://gomagick.herokuapp.com>

Powered by ImageMagick bindings from <https://github.com/quirkey/magick>

## Usage

Example: <http://gomagick.herokuapp.com/img?size=100x100&url=https://github.com/apple-touch-icon.png>


* Endpoint: <http://gomagick.herokuapp.com/img>
* Params:
	* `url`: http/https URL
	* `size`: 64x64, 90%



## Performance

Every request returns the `X-Image-Timings` header containing performance metrics:
